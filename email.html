    <div>Hi <?=`${data.firstName}`?> and welcome to Rutgers Prep!</div><br />

	<div>My name is Michael Nardulli, I’m the Associate Director of Technology, and I make up one-third of our IT department.  When you arrive on campus you’ll meet Omar Simpson, our technician, and Mark Nastus, the Director of Technology.  In the meantime if you need anything from our department please don’t hesitate to contact us by email at <a href='mailto:mom@rutgersprep.org'>mom@rutgersprep.org</a> and someone will get back to you.</div><br />

	<div>Now, this email is to help walk you through setting up all of your digital accounts for your time at Rutgers Prep, including email, ArgoNet, and on campus wifi access.</div><br />

	<div>As to how to access your accounts:</div><br />

	<div>-----</div><br />

	<div style='font-weight: bold;'>ArgoNet</div><br />

	<div>Argonet is our Learning Management System (LMS).  It's the place online where you can find information about your classes, extracurriculars, athletics, homework, attendance.  There's almost nothing we do that isn't, in some way, represented on ArgoNet.</div><br />

	<div>To get logged in head over to the login page.  You can navigate directly to it by going to <a href='https://rutgersprep.myschoolapp.com'>argonet.rutgersprep.org</a>.  It is also accessible by going to <a href='https://www.rutgersprep.org'>rutgersprep.org</a> and clicking the link at the top of the page.</div><br />

	<div>Once you have reached the login page, please enter the following username to being the login process:</div><br />

	<div style='font-weight: bold;'>username: <?=`${data.username}`?></div><br />

	<div>This will begin the account setup process.  Specific instructions for how to navigate this process can be found here:</div><br />

	<div><a href='https://www.rutgersprep.org/instructions'>https://www.rutgersprep.org/instructions</a></div><br />

	<div>Any time that you are asked for a username please use the username listed above.  When asked to enter a password please use the following:</div><br />

	<div style='font-weight: bold;'>password:  <?=`${data.tempPassword}`?></div><br />

	<div>You will then be asked to reset the password to something that only you know.</div><br />

	<div>Once you get logged in all of your account credentials will have been created automatically.  This includes:</div><br />

	<div>ArgoNet</div>
	<div>Email / Google Workspace</div>
	<div>RPSnet (the on campus wifi)</div>
	<div>Credentials for printing</div>

	<div>When asked to log into any of these services just use the name and password that you created as part of this process.</div><br />

	<div>-----</div><br />

	<div style='font-weight: bold;'>Email (Google Workspace Account)</div><br />

	<div>Printing and RPSnet aren't something that you can use until you're on campus, however, your Google Workspace Account is available immediately.</div><br />

	<div>To access it go to <a href='https://mail.google.com'>https://www.gmail.com</a>.  If you're using the same browser you used to setup your account above you should be logged in automatically, however, if you need to log in just use the username and password you created above.</div><br />

	<div>Once logged in feel free to use this as you would a regular Gmail account.  In addition to email, this account gives you access to everything that comes with a Google Account: Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Docs, etc…. If you need any help or have any questions on how any of this works please don’t hesitate to ask.</div><br />

	<div>Also note, you may see some email waiting for you when you first log in.  Please make sure to look through it all, some may not be important, but any of it could be.  This is because you have already been added to a few of our internal distribution lists and you may have had some communications sent to you that were a part of those.</div><br />

	<div>-----</div><br />

	<div>If you run into any issues, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Your best bet for getting your question answered quickly is to email the RPS tech department email, which is <a href='mailto:mom@rutgersprep.org'>mom@rutgersprep.org</a>.</div><br />

	<div>Thanks and, once again, welcome to Rutgers Prep!</div><br />
